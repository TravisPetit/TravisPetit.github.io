<h2> Using Cordial 2 </h2>
<p>
This section describes how to use Cordial 2 for the end-user, i.e. the client side.
Readers interested in managing the server-side of Cordial 2 are advised to read the <a href="todo"> Cordial 2 Developer Manual instead</a>.
</p>


<p>
When firing up Cordial 2, the user is greeted with the Widget shown below in Fig. 1. It is comprised of three tabs (Overview, Server and Statistics) and a menu bar called <u>F</u>ile.

<h3>
Loading file(s) to Cordial 2
</h3>
The first thing the user should do when opening Cordial 2 is loading one or more files into the current session.
There are three diferent ways of doing this.

<p>
First, one can load a previous session (<u>F</u>ile -> load sessio<u>n</u>), this will load all the files and connections from such session. By default these are saved under <tt>/home/username/CORDIAL-SERVER/sessions</tt>.
</p>

<p>
One can also load single nifti files to (<u>F</u>ile -> load sessio<u>n</u>).
</p>

<p>
Finally, many nifti files can be loaded at once with the load directory (<u>F</u>ile -> load sessio<u>n</u>).
This option opens another widget, called "Add". Rules made up of filenames and/or wildcards must glued together in a graph so that the matching files and subfiles of the chosen directory are loaded. The wildcard symbol is the asterisk *.
</p>
Here are some examples.
